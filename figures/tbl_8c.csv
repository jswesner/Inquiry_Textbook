B,"Another important factor contributing to global birth rates is the quality of healthcare. Accessibility to quality healthcare shows an increase in birth rates, lower infant mortality rates, and also an increase in the life expectancy for infants (Bitler and Schmidt, 2012)."
C,There are many other variables that need to be explored to understand how agriculture may affect water quality and public health… These all will be studied to clearly understand if water quality is significantly affected by agriculture and therefore how it can be resolved.
D,"Despite the high incidence among arthropods in general, little research exists on the incidence of Wolbachia in aquatic insects, defined as insects whose larval stages are in freshwater aquatic environments. For example, using data from a recent global meta-analysis (Hilgenboecker et al. 2008), we estimate that less than 5% of tested insect species have aquatic stages in their life-history."
