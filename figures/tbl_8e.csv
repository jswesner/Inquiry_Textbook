A,"Although nothing is certain, I think you and Smarla have enough in common, and under the circumstances, you probably couldn’t do a whole lot better."
B,"We speculate that education will have the least amount of impact on birth rates per woman in 175 countries, because education does not determine if women are fit to have a child. We hypothesize that healthcare will have a slightly greater impact because of the role contraceptives play in healthcare."
C,"We hypothesized that the percentage of agricultural land in a region will inversely correlate to that region’s quality of water. Areas of the world with more intense agricultural practices should then exhibit a lower quality of water, and therefore a lower quality of public health."
D,"Here, we estimate the incidence of Wolbachia in aquatic and terrestrial insects using data from our own field collections along with previously published databases (Sontowski et al. (2015), Weinert et al. (2015), Wiwatanaratanabutr et al. (2016)). We present estimates of Wolbachia incidence for aquatic and terrestrial insects as a whole, and also for individual orders of major aquatic insects."
