#What is the statistical relationship between a country's birth rate and it's population size? 

In this final example, we'll use the tools you've learned to model the relationship between a country's birth rate and it's population size. Perhaps we have a hypothesis that birth rates are positively correlated to population size (after we've read the pertinent literature on this topic, of course).

You already have a data set of birth rates.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
total_fertility_long <- read_csv("children_per_woman_total_fertility.csv") %>% 
  gather(year, children_per_woman, -country)
```


```{r}
total_fertility_long
```

Now we need a data set of population sizes. For this exercise, we'll use the *gapminder* package in R to get population data. 
```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder")
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```
```{r}
data(gapminder_unfiltered)
```

You should see the gapminder_unfiltered data set in your Environment (upper right window). Take a look at it.
```{r}
head(gapminder_unfiltered) #head() shows the first six rows of a data set.
```

We're interested in testing the relationship between population size and birth rate, so we need to combine those two variables in a single data set. The code below will do that using *merge()*.
```{r}
pop_br <- gapminder_unfiltered %>% merge(total_fertility_long)
```

Let's check the result.
```{r}
head(pop_br)
```

Do you see the new column with *children_per_woman*? Also note that this data set is quite a bit smaller than the *total_fertility_long* data set. Why do you think that is?

There are also some other variables in our data set. They're not a problem and we can simply ignore them for this analysis.

Let's plot the relationship with *children_per_woman* on the x-axis and *population* on the y-axis. First we need to pick a year to analyze. The data set goes from 1950 to 2007. Let's start with 1950. 

```{r}
pop_br1950 <- pop_br %>% filter(year == 1950) #filter the data set to only include 1950

ggplot(pop_br1950, aes(x = children_per_woman, y = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

What would you conclude from this? Our hypothesis was that birth rates are positively correlated to population size. What do you think? 

We can stare at the plot all day long, but we really need some numbers to assess our hypothesis. Let's use a linear regression, like you learned before.

```{r}
pop_br_model <- lm(pop ~ children_per_woman, data = pop_br1950)

summary(pop_br_model)
```

How would you interpret this? It shows a slope of -4047020. Here's what that means: "*On average, every unit increase in the number of birth's was associated with a decline in population size of ~4 million people*". The standard error is huge though (3.4 million), nearly as large as the average. We would interpret that like this: "*There is large uncertainty in this estimate, however. The standard error is 3.4 million, indicating that a decline of anywhere between ~0 to 7.4 million people is a reasonable guess based on this model. These numbers indicate little support for the hypothesis that birth rate is positively correlated with population size.*" 

Can you repeat this analysis, but with 2007 data? Does anything change?
